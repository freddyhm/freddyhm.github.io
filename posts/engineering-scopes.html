								<h1>Which Engineering Scope Are You Using?</h1>						
								<div class="blog-detail">Posted <span>17 August 2023</span></div> 
								<div class="blog-content">
									<p>In the few years I've been working in tech, I've started to see common patterns that engineers adopt to solve most problems. For example, here's a popular problem with different approaches:</p>
									<p><strong>Problem:</strong> The way we clean our client's archives is complex and messy.</p>

										Craftsman's scope - How to make the piece better?

									<blockquote>
									<p><em>"Maybe we can simplify the clean up script. Can we possibly use another language with built-in features we can leverage, maybe one with less dependencies?"</em></p>
									</blockquote>
									
									<p>It's the stereotypical engineering work we find in TV and movies. This is the scope that can spend days or years focused on extracting +5% of efficiency out of a component. It's where algorithms are born and faster compute time is achieved.</p>

									<blockquote>
									<p><em>"Since the data is spread out evenly, maybe we can create a centralized service that cleans each archive at a certain frequency?"</em></p>
									</blockquote>
									
									<p>The Architect scope is focused on arranging the pieces to produce an elegant system. Tools for this problem are still rooted in technology, but seen through a lens that encompasses more abstract concepts like patterns, relationships, coordination, and communication.</p>

									<blockquote>
									<p><em>"Maybe we should confirm that our users even need this data. How often do they access it? Can they live with only the last X number of backups?"</em></p>
									</blockquote>
									
									<p>In this scope, technology is simply a giant lever to fill a <em>real</em> need. Communication and vision are the most useful tools here since uncovering needs and addressing them efficiently is much more about understanding than technology's use.</p>

									Finding a great solution requires the right mix
									</h4>
									
									<p>I believe much of what plagues software engineering is that we simply <strong>copy roles from other disciplines</strong>, but we don't organize our thinking around what those roles <em>actually</em> mean. Or ignore the fact that some scopes tend to misalign with people's preference.</p>
									
									<p>Titles like <em>"architect"</em>, <em>"senior engineer"</em>, and <em>"manager"</em> should technically embody one scope over the other, but I rarely see that level of separation in thinking. Especially when those positions are filled by engineers who have spent <em>years</em> looking at problems deeply through a <strong>Craftsman</strong> scope.</p>
									
									<blockquote>
									<p><em>"If you've ever had a manager spend hours preaching the benefits of a mapping library, while you have yet to have a talk about your career progression, you can see the scope misuse at work"</em>  </p>
									</blockquote>
									
									<p><strong>My hypothesis</strong>: When the three scopes are used effectively, teams are much more productive in achieving the best possible solution to a given problem. </p>

									Have you seen these scopes in the wild? Do you lean towards one more than the other?
