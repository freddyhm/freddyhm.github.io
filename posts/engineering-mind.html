								<h1>Which engineering mind are you using?</h1>

									<p>A professor once told me, if a company has no problems than you have no job. If there's one thing that groups all engineers in one bucket is the fact that we love to solve problems. In the few years I've been working in tech, I've started to see a few ways of thinking that people adopt to solve a particular problem:</p>
									<ul class="list-style">
										<li> Craftsman mind - How can we make this piece better?</li>
										<p>It's the individual piece. It's the classic engineer we find in TV and movies. This is the mindset that can spend hours extracting 5% of efficiency out of a system. It's where algorithms are born and faster compute time is achieved. Motivation is often rooted in producing something better than what came before it, and the brain-teasing challenge that comes from it.</p>
										<li> Architect mind - How can we make the system better?</li>
										<p>How will the pieces fit together? How will it grow? Arranging the pieces to produce an elegant system is what the Architect mind thrives on. Similar to a music conductor, the Architect is concerned with the cohesion between the pieces to achieve a bigger goal. Tools for this problem set are still rooted in technology, but seen through a scope that encompasses more abstract concepts like patterns, relationships, coordination, and communication.</p>			
										<li>Entrepreneurial - How can we serve the client better?</li>
										<p>For this mindset, technology is a giant lever to fill a need. The motivation is building something that is useful, and that will provide significant value to someone. Communication and vision plays the biggest role here since uncovering needs and addressing them is much more about intuition than technology. The ambiguity of the problem tends to pull certain people in, and repel others.</p>
									</ul>
									<span>Here's an example of how I've seen different mindsets approach the same problem:</span> 
									<blockquote>
										Problem: The way we clean our client's archives is complex and messy.
										<br />
										Craftsman: Maybe we can simplify the clean up script. Can we possibly use another language with built-in features we can leverage, maybe one with less dependencies?
										<br />
										Architect: Since the data is spread out evenly, maybe we can create a centralized service that cleans each archive at a certain frequency?
										<br />
										Entrepreneurial: Maybe we should confirm that our client even needs this data. How often do they access it? Can they live with only the last X number of backups?
									</blockquote>
									<p>
										On paper, titles like "architect", "senior engineer", and "manager" should technically embody one mindset over the other, but I rarely see that level of separation in thinking. Especially when those positions are filled by engineers who have spent lots of time thinking as Craftsman. 
										<br />
										<br />
										More often what I do see is people adopt mindsets based on what appears to be a combination of preference and experience. 
										I think it's crucial that we recognize these ways of thinking, and spend more time identifying them. I found that they often influence heavily which solution is picked, how we work on problems, and even how a team collaborates day-to-day. 
										<br />
										<br />
										Have you seen these mindsets in the wild? Do you lean towards one more than the other? 
										<br />
										<br />
										In the next post, I'll talk a bit more about a few ideas on we can leverage engineering mindsets to build a more cohesive team and solve problems more efficiently.
